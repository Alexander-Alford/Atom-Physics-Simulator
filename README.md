# Atomic Physics Simulator

This program is an atomic physics simulation written in Python using the VPython module. VPython provides vector math, user input through buttons and sliders, and graphical display wish 3 dimensional objects and graphing capabilities. When ran, VPython transpiles the Python code to Javascript using RapydScript and rund the program in browser with the help of the GlowScript library. This simulator demonstrates a single electron orbiting a hydrogen atom via classical electrostatic attraction with the ability to change the attractive force between the two. A graph is presented that takes readings of the electron's radial distance and graphs it into histograms side by side with the actual tested graph of the hydrogen atom radial probability function given by Shrodinger's equation. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate through user interaction that it is impossible for classical physics to account for the tested hydrogen atom redius by treating the problem as a 2-body problem. Regardless of how much the user tries, they will never be able to create an orbit that gives a radial graph similar to the tested graph it is compared against. This intuitively demonstrates the need for a more distinct treatment of the issue of quantum mechanics compared to that of classical mechanics.
